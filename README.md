### Setup

You'll need to get your connection strings from Firebase. Place a file called config.js in src/Config/ that contains your Firebase config as a simple javascript object, exported as DB_CONFIG. For example,
```
export const DB_CONFIG ={
  apiKey: your_api_key,
  authDomain: your_auth_domain,
  // etc..
}
```
### Starting the app

```
npm install
npm start
```
